He is now known as the “Celluloid Soldier” in our circles. After years we have finally convinced him to return to sunny South Africa and all we can say is watch out for the emotional journey this man can conjure up when he’s behind a camera. His absolute passion for the outdoors and filmmaking also makes him our go-to guy when it comes to location shoots all across South Africa.</p>
